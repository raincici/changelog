Release 5.5
------------------

This is the first GA release in the 5.5 release series. This release finalizes the 5.5
APIs and adds several experimental features and improvements, such as request multiplexing
over a shared HTTP/2 connection and the Classic API facade acting as a compatibility
bridge between classic I/O client services and the asynchronous message transport used
internally.

Notable changes and features included in the 5.5 series:

* Improved conformance to RFC 7616 (HTTP Digest Access Authentication).

* The connection pool implementation acts as a caching facade in front of a standard
  managed connection pool and shares already leased connections to multiplex message
  exchanges over active HTTP/2 connections. Experimental.

* Extended Auth API and improved authentication protocol logic to support mutual
  authentication.

* The Classic API facade now acts as a compatibility bridge between the classic I/O client
  services (based on the standard InputStream / OutputStream model) and the asynchronous
  message transport used internally. This is experimental.

* HTTP/2 support for the Fluent Facade (via Classic API facade). This is experimental.


Compatibility notes:

* As of this release, HttpClient does not automatically execute redirects if the original
  request manually added headers that are considered sensitive.
