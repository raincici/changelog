v5.3.2
Highlights
Passing a percentage unit to the global abs() is deprecated since Dart Sass v1.65.0. It resulted in a deprecation warning when compiling Bootstrap with Dart Sass. This has been fixed internally by changing the values passed to the divide() function. The divide() function has not been fixed itself so that we can keep supporting node-sass cross-compatibility. In v6, this won't be an issue as we plan to drop support for node-sass.
Using multiple ids in a collapse target wasn't working anymore and has been fixed.
Color modes
Increased color contrast of form range track background in light and dark modes.
Fixed table state rendering for color modes with a focus on the striped table in dark mode to increase color contrast.
Allow <mark> color customization for color modes.
Docs
Added alternative CDNs section in Getting started -> Download.
Added Discord and Bootstrap subreddit links in README and Getting started -> Introduction:
Discord maintained by the community
Bootstrap subreddit


v5.3.3
Highlights
Fixed a breaking change introduced with color modes where it was required to manually import variables-dark.scss when building Bootstrap with Sass. Now, _variables.scss will automatically import _variables-dark.scss. If you were already importing _variables-dark.scss manually, you should keep doing it as it won't break anything and will be the way to go in v6.
Fixed a regression in the selector engine that wasn't able to handle multiple IDs anymore.
Color modes
Badges now use the .text-bg-* text utilities to be certain that the text is always readable (especially when the customized colors are different in light and dark modes).
Fixed our color-modes.js script to handle the case where the OS is set to light mode and the auto color mode is used on the website. If you copied the script from our docs, you should apply this change to your own script.
Fixed color schemes description in the color modes documentation to show that color-scheme() only accept light and dark values as parameters.
Miscellaneous
Allowed <dl>, <dt> and <dd> in the sanitizer.
Dropped evenly items distribution for modal and offcanvas headers.
Fixed the accordion CSS selectors to avoid inheritance issues when nesting accordions.
Fixed the focus box-shadow for the validation stated form controls.
Fixed the focus ring on focused checked buttons.
Fixed the product example mobile navbar toggler.
Changed the RTL processing of carousel control icons.
